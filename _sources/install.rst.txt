Toolkit Installation
====================

This is a guide for the toolkit installation only. 

Dependencies
------------

The toolkit contains following imports:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow import keras
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
    from matplotlib.lines import Line2D
    from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
    import seaborn as sns

.. note::

    | You don't need to install mpl_toolkits.
    | It comes with matplotlib package.
    | But you do need to import that if you want 3D graphics.

Importing
---------

After you installed the dependencies, you just need to import the toolkit.

.. code-block:: python

    import DGCNN_toolkit as nn
    import analysis_toolkit as atk
